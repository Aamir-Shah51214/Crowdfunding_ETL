# Crowdfunding_ETL
This project was designed to build a data pipeline that integrates crowdfunding data, processes it through an ETL framework, and stores the results in a relational database. The goal was to extract raw crowdfunding data, transform it to fit business requirements, and load it into a structured SQL database for analysis and reporting.
